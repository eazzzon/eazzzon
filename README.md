### Hi, welcome to my Github!

I am Yishen (Eason), PhD student KU Leuven, Belgium. 

My research combines experimental petrology and numerical modelling. I use experiments and codes to improve our understanding on the volcanism in the Earth system.


Here is the place hosting my codes I developped with my colleages and friends.
